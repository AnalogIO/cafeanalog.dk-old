			<p>If you’ve made it to this website, it means that you are interested in joining Analog. That's awesome to hear - thank you!</p>

			<h1>What is Café Analog?</h1>
			<p>Analog is ITU’s student-run, non-profit café, serving coffee and tea to more than 500 students a day. We’re comprised of about 100 students and faculty members of all majors, nationalities and ages, working together to make Analog the best, most “hygge”, place on ITU.</p>
			<p>Analog is an organization with a flat structure. We elect a new board, called Analogen, every semester, but we are at no different level than any other volunteer - we all started as baristas just like you.</p>
			<h1>What we expect from you as a volunteer</h1>
			<p>Keeping a café open from 7:45-16 every week day is hard work, and so, volunteering in Analog requires trust. We need reliable, enthusiastic people to join our organization. We expect you to take initiative, and to consult your fellow volunteers about your ideas. Anyone in Analog can improve on what we do, but being more than 100 people in an organization means that we need to improve upon ourselves collaboratively.</p>
			<p>We have various roles that need filling, but most of our volunteers are baristas, i.e. they take shifts and make coffee. Other volunteers plan our shifts, manage our storage, plan our monthly hangouts, audit our financial accounts and so on. Everyone has to go through barista training though, but as you become more involved in Analog, you can move onto other responsibilities. As a barista, you are expected to take a <b>two-three hour shift every week</b>. The other roles have varying degrees of expected work load.</p>
			<h1>What’s in it for you?</h1>
			<p>Volunteering in Analog is hard work, but it also comes with some great benefits. First of all, you join the Analog family, which means a chance to meet the greatest people at ITU across majors and classes. We get together several times per semester to hang out and get to know each other better. For example we've played pentanque at BouleBar, painted mugs at Creative Space and played mini golf at Camping Bar. We also host events in the café for all of ITU.</p>
			<p>Additionally, all volunteers can enjoy free black coffee and tea, as well as espresso drinks at a heavily reduced price.</p>
			<!--<h1>Muy Muy Importante</h1>
			<p>The fall semester of 2014 is going to be an exciting new time for Analog, as we’ll be moving into a new, bigger space. This means that we are going to face a lot of new challenges that we will have to solve together. This will be new to the experienced volunteers and board as well. A new space however also comes with the opportunity to make the new Analog so much better than it has ever been, as long as we work together.</p>-->

			<p>In Analog we use Facebook to communicate, and so we expect you to check and actively engage with the Facebook group regularly.</p>
			<h1>Final info</h1>
			<p>We’re excited that you have gotten this far, and are still interested in joining our family. If you do however have any unanswered questions, you are welcome to get in touch with Analog’s board at <b><em>analogen[at]cafeanalog[dot]dk</em></b>.</p>
          <p>By applying, you are also telling us that <ul>you’ve read and understood</ul>, what being an Analog member requires.</p>
